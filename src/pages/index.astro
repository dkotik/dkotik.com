      A dialog between a westerner and an easterner can be reminiscent of a
      first contact scene between two alien civilizations from a typical science
      fiction movie. Premises that underlie either intellectual world are poised
      in defiance of any cultural intuition. We are confused and have a
      difficult time understanding one another. ‚ÄúDivine Energy in Orthodox
      Liturgy‚Äù is a journey into the single most concentrated locus of Eastern
      thought, the Byzantine Liturgy, in which you will discover the heart of
      pure Eastern mysticism in its vibrant Christian forms. On this journey,
      you will gain the ability to better understand and appreciate both
      historic Christianity and Eastern thought as a whole.

      Even if you stayed away from computer games, they did not stay away from
      you. They found their way into your pocket. And now that they made a
      little nest there, your kids got their hands on it. You, or someone you
      know and care about deeply, are becoming entangled with the virtual world
      of computer games. Technology is a dangerous tool in careless hands. If

      deal with them, especially in the area of electronic entertainment, this
      book is for you..
