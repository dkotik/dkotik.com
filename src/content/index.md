        A dialog between a westerner and an easterner can be reminiscent of a first contact scene between two alien civilizations from a typical science fiction movie. Premises that underlie either intellectual world are poised in defiance of any cultural intuition. We are confused and have a difficult time understanding one another. “Divine Energy in Orthodox Liturgy” is a journey into the single most concentrated locus of Eastern thought, the Byzantine Liturgy, in which you will discover the heart of pure Eastern mysticism in its vibrant Christian forms. On this journey, you will gain the ability to better understand and appreciate both historic Christianity and Eastern thought as a whole.
